#### Testing

```
go test -v -c cover
```

#### Quotes

> Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer

> Interfaces are a great tool for hiding complexity away from other parts of the system. In our case our test helper code did not need to know the exact shape it was asserting on, only how to "ask" for its area.
